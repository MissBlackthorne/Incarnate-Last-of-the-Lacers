			"The akhlut is a beast that haunts the Great Glacier. It is spoken about in hushed whispers by the people of the water clan, one of the many trials they must endure that other nations of the world typically never learn about.",
			"{@b Shapeshifter.} The akhlut's most distinguishing feature is its ability to change its shape. In water, the akhlut appears as a normal, although still dangerous, killer whale. The akhlut's true power, however, is to come onto land and take the shape of a gigantic wolf. On land, the akhlut keeps its distinguishing markings of black and white, identifying it immediately.",
			"{@b Solitary Hunter.} Unlike both killer whales and wolves, akhlut are loners, existing as unstoppable forces of nature. The akhlut exists alone, with its tendency to eat everything in its path setting it apart from normal animals, whom the water clan respect as a part of nature. The akhlut is seen as apart from nature, an evil presence that should be avoided or destroyed at all costs.",
			"{@b Muddy Footprints.} The territory of an akhlut can be identified by wolf pawprints that lead to the water. While akhlut look visually distinct with their black and white markings, dogs that wander too close to the water, or spend too much time there, are often distrusted by the people of the water clan, who are suspicous that the normal dog may inherit the akhlut's taint and become one of them."
