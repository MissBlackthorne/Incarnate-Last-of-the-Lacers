			"Travelers who have passed through the deepest forests of Petan tell tales of the deer lady, a malevolent spirit that seeks to destroy those it encounters. It entices weary people deeper into the woods with the sound of a friendly voice and the big, brown, innocent eyes of a deer.",
			"{@b Dancer.} The deer lady is said to haunt forests and surrounding communities, and some stories say that they can't resist a dance. Many tales are told of the deer lady having to join communal dances when it sees one, going completely unnoticed, and leaving only when the music ceases.",
			"{@b Vain.} While the deer lady can use her magical wiles to trick others, she is also said to be self-conscious of her cloven hooves  She hides these hooves by remaining on the other side of trees and bushes, and sometimes flees when discovered to  be inhuman.",
			"Other things that can drive away a deer lady are said to be tobacco, and certain chants which are said to hold power over her spiritual nature.",
			"{@b Magical Lure.} Tales of the deer lady say that she forces people (usually men) to fall in love with her, luring them deep into the forest until it is too late for them to escape. These men are trapped by the deer lady's magic, forced to love her and stay with her until they eventually waste away."
