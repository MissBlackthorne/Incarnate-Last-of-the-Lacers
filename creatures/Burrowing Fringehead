			"The burrowing fringehead is a titanic predator that roams underneath the surface of Quoya Desert. The fringehead preys on almost anything that moves, moving the desert from simply a hostile and difficult environment to an unlivable nightmare for all but the most prepared and resourceful.",
			"{@b Intimidating Fringe.} The fringehead has an enormous stretch of skin between its jaws, which it flares to intimidate prey before it feasts on them, as well as to intimidate rivals. The fringe appears in bright primary colors such as red, yellow, and blue, and is used to fight with and attempt to frighten other fringeheads that impose on its territory.",
			"{@b Stalker of the Desert.} Fringeheads swim through loose sand as easily as a fish swims in water. It is unknown whether the fringehead has access to any type of earthlacing to help in this regard, or whether their powerful fins and tails are simply strong enough to propel them through the sand. Like a shark, a fringehead can sometimes be seen approaching when it nears the surface of the sand, as its fins break the surface and reveal its position.",
			"{@b Deadly Encounters.} Stories of burrowing fringeheads are common tales to encourage children from wandering away, but actual encounters have dwindled. No one knows what might lead to the population loss of such a fearsome and powerful predator, but no one assumes that the Quoya Desert is safe because of it."
