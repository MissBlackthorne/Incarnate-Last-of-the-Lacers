The adlet are a simple people, with hunters, warriors, fishermen and others represented in their society. They fear the water clan as much as they are feared, and have their own stories about the evilness of the water clan.",

									"A woman, Qaaynak (the girl), lived with her father, Oki, but would not choose a man to marry, and was hence called Uinigumissuitung (she who wouldn't take a husband). After rejecting all of her suitors, she chose to marry a dog, Ijirqang, who had white and red spots. This greatly angered Oki, but he remained silent. Of their ten children, five were dogs and the others were adlet, with the bodies of men and the legs of dogs. Since Ijirqang would not go hunting and the children were becoming very hungry, it fell to Oki to provide for the full household. With the house too full of hungry children, Oki put them into a boat and carried them to a small island, telling Ijirqang to swim to them to get food for he and Qaaynak. Qaaynak hung a pair of boots around Ijirqang's neck and he swam ashore, but instead of food, Oki put rocks in the shoes. When Ijirqang attempted to swim home, he drowned. In anger, Qaaynak went to her father, and ordered her children to bite him. Oki pushed her into the water and attempted to drown her as he did her husband. Qaaynak survived, but afraid that Oki might turn his wrath to her children, sent the adlet away. All adlet today are the descendents of Qaaynak and Ijirqang. One must always be wary, for the adlet have extreme distrust and anger against humans, who they see as the descendants of Oki, who attempted to kill them all."
