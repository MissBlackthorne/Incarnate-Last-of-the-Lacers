>***Amphibious.*** The abaia can breathe air and water.  
>
>***Rampage.*** When the abaia reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack on its turn, the abaia can take a bonus action to move up to half its speed and make a bite attack.  
>
>### Actions
>***Multiattack.*** The abaia makes two attacks: one with its bite and one to constrict.  
>
>***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:*  +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage.  
>
>***Constrict.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:*  +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Large or smaller creature. *Hit:* 17 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 17 (3d8 + 6) slashing damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 16) if the abaia isn't already constricting a creature, and the target is restrained until this grapple ends.  
>
>***Swallow.*** The abaia makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the abaia, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the abaia's turns. A the abaia can have only one creature swallowed at a time.  
>If the abaia takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the abaia must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the abaia. If the abaia dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.  
>
>***Water Blast (Recharge 5–6).*** The abaia blasts a powerful water stream from its mouth in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 61 (11d10) bludgeoning damage and is pushed 30 feet and knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed or knocked prone.
