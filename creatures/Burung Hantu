			"The burung hantu is an enigmatic creature. Burung hantu are ancient, and no one knows whether they are simply immortal, of if there are multiple burung hantu of the world.",
			"The hantu appears as an enormous barn owl that can speak. Above all, stories of the hantu describe it as seeking knowledge.",
			"There are many stories of the hantu hoarding knowledge, having its servants collect scrolls, books, and other sources of information to keep them for itself.",
			"{@b Knowledge Seeker.} The burung hantu is always surrounded by animals that it uses to steal sources of knowledge. These almost always take the form of foxes. These foxes understand their orders and are found in the far corners of the world, finding sources of knowledge and history and bringing them back to their master. Many stories have sprung up around these animals with a strange glint in their eye seeking out sources of knowledge to steal.",
			"{@b Altered Form.} While the burung hantu is often described as a terrifying if neutral creature, it is rumored that when angry, the hantu grows in size and its body elongates into a serpentine form. It is said to chase down and devour those who would disrespect the hantu or the knowledge it has collected.",
			"{@b Sharing Knowledge}. While the hantu is a reclusive creature (many rumor that it doesn't exist at all, and is only a mythic creature), the hantu is typically depicted as wanting to share its knowledge with those who seek it. So long as the traveler or scholar seeks knowledge for learning's sake, and not to harm others or the environment, the hantu is usually happy to allow others to peruse its vast stores. The worst thing one can do to a burung hantu is to steal from it, which will cause it to become angered and seek to destroy those who have pilfered its knowledge.",
