			"The barking beast is a voracious monster, with the body of a leopard and the head and neck of a poisonous snake. Despite it's snake-like head, the barking beast is so-named for the sound it makes, described as the yelping of a small dog or fox.",
			"{@b Perilous Quest.} Barking beasts are occasionally called questing beasts by the earth kin. These creatures are often disruptive to earth kin communities near their forest dwellings, and so those who see to the protection of the common people have made an event out of hunting down barking beasts and slaying them.",
			"{@b Solitary Hunters.} Barking beasts are loners, rarely coming together except during mating season. Their territories cover vast expanses of the Jungle of Lost Tribes, and they defend this territory ferociously, causing them to attack any who pass through it as though it were a rival barking beast.",
			"{@b Deadly Poison.} The barking beast's most fatal trait is the burning venom that it empties into its prey. The venom of the barking beast is often procured after one is slain, and is synthesized into a deadly poison for administering to one's enemies, or for coating one's weapon."
