			"The boarcupine is a powerful creature that lives primarily in the Winto Forest and Fengwood. Human intervention has cut down on its territory, as the earth kin cleared its native forest for more earth communities. This brings the boarcupine into conflict with people, as they fight to retain their homes.",
			"{@b Fiercely Territorial.} The boarcupine live in small family units, with children being looked after by their parents. Adult boarcupines are incredibly dangerous, with powerful tusks and long quills that cover their backs. Especially when their children are present, boarcupines will defend their families at all costs.",
			"{@b Acupuncture.} Despite these misgivings about people, isolated boarcupine populations have been successfully domesticated. Their immense size allows them to provide a number of resources for the people charged with their care. In addition, juvenile boarcupine quills (which fall out with regularity and can be easily collected from pens) are often used for acupuncture.",
			"{@b Diet of Convenience.} The boarcupine is a highly versatile omnivore, whose diversity of choice in food is only rivalled by people. Boarcupines will eat almost anything, from roots and bulbs, to nuts and berries, leaves and twigs, worms and insects, up to lizards and snakes and other wild game."
